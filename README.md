## Basic Web Scraping

### In this project, we scrapped a [webpage](http://quotes.toscrape.com) for quotes of famous people.
### The quotes where extracted and stored on a csv file.
### The libraries used are
  - requests - for making http requests
  - beautifulsoup4 - act as the scraper
  - csv - to help us write the scrapped quotes to a CSV file
